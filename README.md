# Note
- Since the backend is deployed on the `Render` site the application may take some time while you start talking with backend using frontend.
- Once the backend server is up. Then the next requests does not take time.
- I suggest to run the test at last, So that you can see the functionalities and some blogs inside the application. 
- If tests are run first then the entire database gets empty. 


# Deployed links
- Frontend - `https://blog-platform-three-mauve.vercel.app/`

# How to setup my project.
 
 - Either clone it using this command `git clone https://github.com/seetaramanjaneyulu217/Blog-Platform.git`  else download my zip folder.
 - After doing the above step go into the frontend folder, open terminal and run `npm install`.
 - After that go into the backend folder and run `npm install`.
